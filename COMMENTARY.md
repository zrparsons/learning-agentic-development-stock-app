# Introduction
Im a bit late to the party but this is my first attempt at earnestly engaging with AI. Im going to be building a stock taking app that can handle storing information on products for a theoretical retail company. I plan on relying on the model as much as possible as that is what i have been told to do. I will attempt to create a commit for each and every prompt i write, i will then paste the prompt here along with my running commentary on how i believe this project to be going.

I am using cursor as my IDE and using the in built prompt functionality to interface with claude. I am not using any cli tools as while i am trying to enter this with an open mind i unfortunately do not trust an LLM to be running shell commands on my machine so this separation is necessary for me at the moment.

## Project setup
To start out this project i am creating an initial commit containing this file along with a `./claude/.settings` file and a `.cursorignore` file that excludes this file from context. Unfortunately information on how to best use agents to generate code seems to be sparse and conflicting, this somewhat raises the question of why people feel i need to learn this technology if no one can seem to provide concrete education on how to properly use it, but i digress. One prevailing thought though seems to be that when starting a new project its best to begin with asking claude to help you develop a plan before starting so thats what i intend to do now.
